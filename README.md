# gwiz

Inspired by what [dropwizard](https://www.dropwizard.io/) did with Java, gwiz aims to bring together the best OSS go idioms to make operable systems straightforward.

gwiz currently supports HTTP and GRPC services running on Kubernetes.

gwiz aims to be an umbrella library with some command-line tools, and only minimally cookiecutter/bootstrapper.
